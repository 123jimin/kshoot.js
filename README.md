# kshoot.js

This is JavaScript/TypeScript library for manipulating KSH and KSON chart files of K-Shoot Mania. This project supersedes [kson-js](https://github.com/123jimin/kson-js).

Note that this library is focused on having a simple codebase with as little dependency as possible, and not (yet) on having good time complexity.

Therefore, while this library would be suitable for simple chart processing, for non-trivial data manipulation (such as chart editors), use this library and other data structure libraries together for better performance.
